description: Additional utility commands for drone identification and system configuration.
---

Utility commands provide auxiliary functionality for drone identification, visibility, and system management beyond core flight operations.

## Prerequisites

- Active WebSocket connection
- Valid vehicle ID
- Drone powered on

## Identification Lights

Control the drone's identification lights for visual tracking, night operations, and compliance with aviation regulations.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "identify",
    "state": true
  }
}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `state` | `boolean` | Yes | `true` to enable lights, `false` to disable lights |

### Light States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `true` | Activates identification lights (typically flashing pattern) |
| `false` | Deactivates identification lights |

::alert{type="info"}
Identification lights help locate the drone visually, especially during night operations, low-visibility conditions, or in crowded airspace.

## Use Cases

### Visual Tracking
Enable identification lights when:
- Operating in low-light conditions
- Multiple drones are in the same area
- Observers need to track the drone's position
- Demonstrating or showcasing the aircraft

### Regulatory Compliance
Some jurisdictions require:
- Visible identification during night operations
- Anti-collision lighting for commercial operations
- Visual identification in controlled airspace

### Battery Conservation
Disable lights when:
- Operating in daylight with good visibility
- Extending flight time is critical
- Lights are not required by regulations

## Best Practices

1. **Enable lights for night operations** to maintain visual contact
2. **Disable during daylight** to conserve battery when not needed
3. **Check local regulations** regarding lighting requirements
4. **Test light functionality** before critical operations
5. **Use in combination with other visual aids** (strobes, LEDs) when available

## Safety Considerations

- Identification lights do not replace proper visual line of sight
- Ensure lights are functioning before night flights
- Some lights may drain battery faster - monitor power levels
- Bright lights may affect camera exposure in certain conditions
