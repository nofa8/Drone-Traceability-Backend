title: Flight Commands
description: Basic flight operations for takeoff, landing, and motor control.
---

Basic flight commands provide fundamental control over the drone's operational state, including takeoff, landing, and motor management.

## Prerequisites

- Active WebSocket connection
- Valid vehicle ID
- Drone in ready state (for takeoff)
- Sufficient battery level
- GPS lock (if required by flight mode)

## Takeoff

Initiates the automated takeoff sequence. The drone will arm motors, spin up to operational speed, and ascend to a predetermined hover altitude.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "takeoff"
  }
}
```

::warning
Ensure the landing area is clear and weather conditions are suitable before initiating takeoff.
::

### Takeoff Behavior

1. Motors arm and spin up
2. Ascend to hover altitude (1 meters)
3. Stabilize and await further commands

## Land

Initiates the automated landing sequence at the drone's current position. The aircraft will descend vertically and disarm motors upon ground contact.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "land"
  }
}
```

::note
The drone will automatically detect ground contact and disarm motors safely.
::

### Landing Behavior

1. Reduce altitude gradually
2. Descend to ground level
3. Detect ground contact
4. Disarm motors automatically

## Return to Home

Commands the drone to autonomously return to its home position (typically the takeoff location) and land.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "startGoHome"
  }
}
```

::note
The home position is usually set automatically.
::

### Return to Home Behavior

1. Ascend to safe return altitude (75 meters)
2. Navigate directly to home position
3. Descend and land at home location
4. Disarm motors automatically

## Motor Control

Manually control the state of the aircraft motors. This command provides direct on/off control independent of flight sequences.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "motors",
    "state": true
  }
}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type      | Required | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state`   | `boolean` | Yes      | `true` to arm/start motors, `false` to disarm/stop motors |

::alert{type="danger"}
**Use with extreme caution.** Disarming motors mid-flight will cause the drone to fall. Only use this command on the ground or in emergency situations.
::

### Motor States

| State   | Description                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `true`  | Arms and starts the motors   |
| `false` | Disarms and stops the motors |

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify GPS lock** before takeoff in GPS-dependent flight modes
2. **Check battery level** before initiating any flight operation
3. **Clear the area** around takeoff and landing zones
4. **Monitor telemetry** during automated sequences
5. **Use motor control sparingly** - prefer automated takeoff/landing sequences
6. **Have an emergency plan** ready before each flight
7. **Respect no-fly zones** and local regulations

## Safety Considerations

- Never attempt takeoff indoors without proper clearance
- Ensure propellers are in good condition before flight
- Maintain visual line of sight during manual operations
- Be prepared to execute emergency landing if needed
- Keep motors disarmed when not actively flying
