title: Manual Control
description: Real-time manual flight control and Virtual Stick state management.
---

The system provides real-time manual intervention through a Virtual Stick interface, allowing direct control over the drone's movement via WebSocket commands.

::alert{type="warning"}
Virtual Stick mode must be explicitly enabled before the drone can process any movement inputs.
::

## Prerequisites

- Active WebSocket connection
- Drone in a flyable state (armed and ready)
- Valid vehicle ID

## Virtual Stick State Management

### Enable Virtual Sticks

Transfer control from autonomous flight logic to manual WebSocket commands.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "virtualSticks",
    "state": true
  }
}
```

### Disable Virtual Sticks

Return control to the autonomous flight system.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "virtualSticks",
    "state": false
  }
}
```

## Sending Movement Commands

Once Virtual Stick mode is enabled, send continuous movement inputs to control the drone.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "virtualSticksInput",
    "yaw": 0.5,
    "pitch": -0.2,
    "roll": 0.0,
    "throttle": 0.8
  }
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
Movement commands should be sent continuously every **100-200ms** to maintain smooth and responsive control.
::

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Range | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| `yaw` | `number` | `-1.0` to `1.0` | Rotation around vertical axis (angular velocity) |
| `pitch` | `number` | `-1.0` to `1.0` | Forward (-) / Backward (+) movement (velocity) |
| `roll` | `number` | `-1.0` to `1.0` | Left (-) / Right (+) movement (velocity) |
| `throttle` | `number` | `-1.0` to `1.0` | Vertical Down (-) / Up (+) movement (velocity) |

### Value Conventions

- **Range**: All values are normalized between `-1.0` and `1.0`
- **Neutral**: `0.0` indicates no movement on that axis
- **Positive/Negative**: Direction varies by axis (see table above)

## Best Practices

1. **Always disable** Virtual Stick mode when manual control is no longer needed
2. **Maintain consistent input frequency** (100-200ms intervals) while in manual mode
3. **Gradually adjust** control values to avoid sudden movements
4. **Monitor telemetry** to ensure commands are being executed correctly
