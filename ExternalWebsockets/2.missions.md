description: Missions allow the drone to follow a predefined path with specific start and end actions.
---

Missions enable autonomous flight by defining a sequence of GPS waypoints with configurable start and end actions. The drone will automatically navigate through the specified path.

## Prerequisites

- Active WebSocket connection
- Valid GPS coordinates within operational boundaries
- Drone in a flyable state

## Starting a Mission

Execute a mission by sending a complete mission profile with waypoints and action parameters.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "startMission",
    "startAction": "takeoff",
    "endAction": "goHome",
    "repeat": 0,
    "altitude": 50,
    "path": [
      { "lat": 39.932, "lng": -8.892 },
      { "lat": 39.935, "lng": -8.895 }
    ],
    "status": "RUNNING"
  }
}
```

### Mission Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `startAction` | `string` | Yes | Action to perform before starting the path |
| `endAction` | `string` | Yes | Action to perform after completing the path |
| `repeat` | `number` | No | Number of times to repeat the mission (0 = once) |
| `altitude` | `number` | Yes | Flight altitude in meters |
| `path` | `array` | Yes | Array of GPS coordinate objects |
| `status` | `string` | Yes | Initial mission status |

### Start Actions

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `takeoff` | Automatically take off before starting the mission path |
| `none` | Start mission from current position (drone must already be airborne) |

### End Actions

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `land` | Land at the final waypoint position |
| `goHome` | Return to home position and land |
| `none` | Hold position at final waypoint |

### Path Coordinates

Each waypoint in the `path` array must include:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lat` | `number` | Latitude in decimal degrees |
| `lng` | `number` | Longitude in decimal degrees |

::alert{type="info"}
Waypoints are followed sequentially in the order they appear in the array.
::

## Mission Control

### Pause Mission

Temporarily halt the mission while keeping it loaded. The drone will hold its current position.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "pauseMission"
  }
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
A paused mission can be resumed by sending the `startMission` command again or by using a resume command if available.
::

### Stop Mission

Abort the current mission and return control to manual or idle mode.

```json
{
  "userId": "VEHICLE_ID",
  "message": {
    "command": "stopMission"
  }
}
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Stopping a mission will **not** automatically land the drone. Ensure you send appropriate follow-up commands.
::

## Mission Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `RUNNING` | Mission is actively executing |
| `PAUSED` | Mission is paused at current waypoint |
| `COMPLETED` | Mission finished successfully |
| `STOPPED` | Mission aborted by user command |

## Best Practices

1. **Validate coordinates** before starting a mission to ensure they are within operational boundaries
2. **Set appropriate altitude** considering terrain and obstacles
3. **Use `goHome` end action** for safety unless landing at destination is required
4. **Monitor mission progress** through telemetry data
5. **Test missions** with short paths before executing longer routes
6. **Always have a manual override plan** ready in case of unexpected behavior
